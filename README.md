# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Amazon-Comprehend-
Project Idea This project looks like a text sentiment analysis pipeline: •A user sends text input via an API.  •AWS Comprehend analyzes the sentiment or meaning.  •The result is processed by Lambda.  •If needed, SNS (Simple Notification Service) sends alerts or notifications.  •IAM manages permissions for each service.
